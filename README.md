Some ZX-Uno addons


## License

Each subdirectory contains an addon core or family of cores. They are original, created by me or modified from ZX-Uno official cores or others. You will find a LICENSE.md in each subdirectory with license information for that core.


NOTE: The latest version (GPL-3.0) of the official ZX-Uno ZX Spectrum core can be found [here](https://github.com/mcleod-ideafix/zxuno_spectrum_core)
